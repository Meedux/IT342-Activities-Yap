# IT342-Activities

The Goal of this activity is to integrate the Google Contacts (People) API into a Spring Boot application with a Thymeleaf-based user interface. Students will learn how to authenticate with Google, retrieve contact lists, perform CRUD operations on Google Contacts 

Instructions:
    1. Set Up Google API Credentials
        - Create a Google Cloud Project and Integrate People API
        - Generate OAuth 2.0 Credentials for Authentications
        - Configure The OAuth Consent Screen and add required scopes
    
    2. Backend Development (Springboot)
        - Implement Authentication using OAuth 2.0
        - Develop REST Endpoints for:
            - Retrieving all contacts from the authenticated user's contacts 
            - Adding a new contact 
            - Modifying and Editing an existing contact
            - Removing a contact
    
    3. Front End Development (Thymeleaf UI)
        - Create a User Friendly Interface
        - Provide a form-based input for adding and editing contacts
        - Implement buttons for updating and deleting contacts

    4. Testing and Deployment
        - Run the Application and ensure authentication works
        - Test all CRUD operations using the web interface
        - Debug and Handle errors related to the API requests and authentication


Expected Output:
    - A functional web application that integrates with google contacts
    - Users can view, add, edit, and delete their Google Contacts from the application
